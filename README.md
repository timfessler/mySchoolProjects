# mySchoolProjects
Overview:
This project contains my Memory Game for section 6.
The game is played by selecting one of the cards on the board. That will start the timer. Your moves are tracked and counted at the top.
After 16 moves, the player loses one star from the original three. After 24 moves, the player loses a second star, leaving them just one.
Once all matches are made, a popup modal will congratulate the player and report the stats of that round. There is an option to "Play Again",
which will shuffle the cards on the board and start over.

Dependencies:
You must be connected to the internet to access font css and jquery.min.js files. 
You must download the app.ja, app.css, and index.html files and they need to be stored in the same folder.
